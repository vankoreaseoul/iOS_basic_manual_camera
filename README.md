## iOS_manual_camera

### Intoroduction
This is a sort of mini or toy project about controlling camera.
On the meeting in company, we're thinking of new function to be added on the on-service app.
The selected new idea is about analyzing images and for that, I need to be prepared to controlling camera fully.
The built-in-camera on iPhone is already good enough, cause it automatically adjust focus, exposure and etc, but that's not what I want.
I want to controll camera manually as I want, not automatically. 
So I find and learn how to control camera focus, exposure and white balance.
Hope it can help you guys!

### Feature
- SwiftUI
- AVFoundation

### Attentions
1. Check your camera type before starting the project.
- The built-in-camera type is different depending on iPhone models. So please check if the selected camera type on code is supported on your iPhone model. And you need to recognize that the manual controlling is supported in cerain camera types.
