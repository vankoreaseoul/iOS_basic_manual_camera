## iOS_manual_camera

### Intoroduction
This is a sort of mini or toy project about controlling camera.
On the meeting in company, we're thinking of new function to be added on the on-service app.
The selected new idea is about analyzing images and for that, I need to be prepared to controlling camera fully.
The built-in-camera on iPhone is already good enough, cause it automatically adjust focus, exposure and etc, but that's not what I want.
I want to controll camera manually as I want, not automatically. 
So I find and learn how to control camera focus, exposure and white balance.
Hope it can help you guys!
